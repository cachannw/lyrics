      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
      <br />
      I messed up tonight, I lost another fight<br />
      Lost to myself, but I'll just start again<br />
      I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground<br />
      I always get up now, see what's next<br />
      Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up<br />
      Nobody learns without gettin' it wrong<br />
      <br />
      I won't give up, no, I won't give in<br />
      'Til I reach the end, and then I'll start again<br />
      No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything<br />
      I wanna try even though I could fail<br />
      I won't give up, no, I won't give in<br />
      'Til I reach the end, and then I'll start again<br />
      No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything<br />
      I wanna try even though I could fail<br />
      <br />
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
      Try everything<br />
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
      Try everything<br />
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
      Try everything<br />
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
      <br />
      Look how far you've come, you filled your heart with love<br />
      Baby, you've done enough, take a deep breath<br />
      Don't beat yourself up, no need to run so fast<br />
      Sometimes we come last, but we did our best<br />
      I won't give up, no, I won't give in<br />
      'Til I reach the end, and then I'll start again<br />
      <br />
      No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything<br />
      I wanna try even though I could fail<br />
      I won't give up, no, I won't give in<br />
      'Til I reach the end, and then I'll start again<br />
      No, I won't leave, I wanna try everything<br />
      I wanna try even though I could fail<br />
      I'll keep on making those new mistakes<br />
      I'll keep on making them every day<br />
      Those new mistakes<br />
      <br />
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
      Try everything<br />
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
      Try everything<br />
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
      Try everything<br />
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
      Try everything

    <p class="lyrics">
      Do you ever feel like a plastic bag<br />
      Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?<br />
      Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin<br />
      Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?<br />
      Do you ever feel already buried deep?<br />
      Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing<br />
      Do you know that there's still a chance for you?<br />
      'Cause there's a spark in you<br />
      You just gotta ignite the light<br />
      And let it shine<br />
      Just own the night<br />
      Like the Fourth of July<br />
      'Cause baby, you're a firework<br />
      Come on, show 'em what you're worth<br />
      Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"<br />
      As you shoot across the sky<br />
      Baby, you're a firework<br />
      Come on, let your colors burst<br />
      Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"<br />
      You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe<br />
      You don't have to feel like a waste of space<br />
      You're original, cannot be replaced<br />
      If you only knew what the future holds<br />
      After a hurricane comes a rainbow<br />
      Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed<br />
      So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road<br />
      Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow<br />
      And when it's time, you'll know<br />
      You just gotta ignite the light<br />
      And let it shine<br />
      Just own the night<br />
      Like the Fourth of July<br />
      'Cause baby, you're a firework<br />
      Come on, show 'em what you're worth<br />
      Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"<br />
      As you shoot across the sky<br />
      Baby, you're a firework<br />
      Come on, let your colors burst<br />
      Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"<br />
      You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe<br />
      Boom, boom, boom<br />
      Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon<br />
      It's always been inside of you, you, you<br />
      And now it's time to let it through<br />
      'Cause baby, you're a firework<br />
      Come on, show 'em what you're worth<br />
      Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"<br />
      As you shoot across the sky<br />
      Baby, you're a firework<br />
      Come on, let your colors burst<br />
      Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"<br />
      You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe<br />
      Boom, boom, boom<br />
      Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon<br />
      Boom, boom, boom<br />
      Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
